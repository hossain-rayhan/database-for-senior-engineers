# Vector Databases: A Beginner’s Guide

## What is a Vector Database?
A vector database is a specialized system designed to store, index, and search high-dimensional vectors. These are arrays of numbers that represent data such as text, images, or audio. These vectors, also called embeddings, are generated by AI models and capture the semantic meaning of the original data.

## Why Do We Need Vector Databases?
Traditional databases are great for structured data and exact matches. However, modern AI applications often require searching for items that are semantically similar, not just identical. For example, finding documents with similar meaning, recommending products, or enabling chatbots to retrieve relevant information. Vector databases make this possible by enabling fast similarity search on embeddings.

## How Do Vector Databases Work?
1. **Embedding Generation:** AI models (like GPT, BERT, or image encoders) convert data into vectors (for example, [0.12, -0.98, 0.33, ...]).
2. **Storage:** These vectors are stored in a database, often alongside the original data.
3. **Similarity Search:** When a query comes in, it is also converted to a vector. The database then finds the most similar vectors using distance metrics such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

## Example: Storing and Searching Vectors

Suppose you have two sentences:
• "Mountains are beautiful in the fall."
• "The ocean looks great in the spring."



An AI model might generate these embeddings:
• "Mountains are beautiful in the fall.": [0.12, -0.98, 0.33, 0.44]
• "The ocean looks great in the spring.": [0.10, -0.95, 0.30, 0.40]

In PostgreSQL (with the pgvector extension):
```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  content text,
  embedding vector(4)
);
INSERT INTO documents (content, embedding)
VALUES ('Mountains are beautiful in the fall.', '[0.12, -0.98, 0.33, 0.44]');
```

In MongoDB:
```json
{
  "content": "Mountains are beautiful in the fall.",
  "embedding": [0.12, -0.98, 0.33, 0.44]
}
```
## Where and Why Vector Databases Are Used in LLM Applications

Vector databases play a key role in the inference and retrieval stages of large language model (LLM) applications. Here’s how they fit into the workflow:

1. **Training:**
  - The LLM is trained on large datasets, and the result is a set of model weights (parameters). Vector databases are not used at this stage.

2. **Inference (Serving):**
  - The trained model is loaded into memory—typically on GPUs or TPUs for high performance, not into a database.
  - When you want to generate embeddings for your data (documents, images, etc.), the model processes each item and produces a vector (embedding).
  - These embeddings are stored in a vector database for fast similarity search.
  - As a user, your question or prompt is used as the inference input for the model.

3. **Query/Retrieval:**
  - When a user submits a query, it is converted to an embedding using the same model (again, running on GPU/TPU, not in the database).
  - The vector database is searched for the most similar embeddings, returning relevant items (documents, passages, etc.).
  - This is essential for semantic search, recommendations, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the LLM uses retrieved context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.
  - The query to the vector database is triggered by the backend service, not directly by the end user.

**Key Clarification:**
- The trained model itself (its weights and architecture) is loaded into GPU or TPU memory for inference and embedding generation. It is not stored in the vector database.
- The vector database only stores the embeddings (vectors) and associated metadata, enabling fast and scalable similarity search.

## Popular Vector Databases
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Milvus
- Qdrant
- Vespa
- Chroma
- Redis (with vector search module)
- Elasticsearch (with vector search support)
- Azure CosmosDB (with vector search)
- Amazon OpenSearch Service
- PostgreSQL (with pgvector extension)
- MongoDB Atlas (with vector search)

## Vector Search in Cloud Databases
Major cloud providers now offer vector search features:
- **Azure CosmosDB:** Native vector search support.
- **AWS:** Amazon OpenSearch Service, Aurora, and RDS for PostgreSQL (with pgvector).
- **Google Cloud:** Vertex AI and BigQuery with vector search.

## Dedicated vs. General-Purpose Databases
- **Dedicated vector databases** (like Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate) are optimized for large-scale, high-performance vector search.
- **General-purpose databases** (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CosmosDB) can support vector search via extensions or built-in features, making it easier to integrate with existing data.

## Use Cases
- Semantic search (finding similar documents or images)
- Recommendation systems
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for LLMs
- Fraud detection and anomaly detection
- Clustering and classification

## How Vector Search Works
1. Store embeddings for your data.
2. When a query arrives, generate its embedding.
3. Search for the most similar vectors in the database (top-k search).

## Summary
A vector database enables you to store and search embeddings efficiently, powering modern AI applications like semantic search and recommendations. Whether you use a dedicated vector database or add vector search to an existing system, the core idea is the same: store vectors and find the most similar ones quickly and accurately.
